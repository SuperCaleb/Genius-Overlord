**Oden's Corruption system is AI inspired attack program the Instructions, will be sent soon as you execute."




1. **Oden's Data Log**:
   - This code primarily serves to log network-related activities and simulate a tracking system within a network.

2. **Oden's Pen Test**:
   - This code primarily serves to log the steps involved in a penetration test and simulate the process of checking for network breakthroughs.

3. **Oden's Corruption System Code**:
   - Demonstrates the usage of the StrikingHack class methods by creating an instance and calling its methods to activate penetration, corrupt the system, check the system, and initiate a counterattack.

4. **Oden's Defense System**:
   - This code primarily serves to log various stages of a defense system, including data clearance, protection activation, and data encryption.

5. **Oden's Entity**:
   - Demonstrates the usage of various classes and functions to simulate data collection, security checks, network management, penetration testing, and automated processes.
   - 6. **Eyes of Oden**:
        The provided script defines a class Eye_of_oden that simulates a tracking system with sensors, called "Oden's eyes." It includes methods to initialize and control the sensors, detect objects, and report the sensor status. The example usage shows how to activate the system, perform object detection, and print the sensor status.
